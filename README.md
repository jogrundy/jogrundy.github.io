Using a combination of two website tutorials , mozilla [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics] and W3 schools https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp

My first effort at Javascript, doesn't run on IE at all, as using ES6, javascript objects.

Code for 'Game of Live' shamelessly hacked from https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/159317/javascript-implementation-of-conways-game-of-life-with-html5-canvas, rewritten to give step button and wrap button.

This code was then even more shamelessly hacked to give the 'Evolutionary Games and Spatial Chaos' code, to make the beautiful patterns.
